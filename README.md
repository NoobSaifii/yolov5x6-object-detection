# Vehicle Detection with YOLOv5 ðŸš—ðŸšŒðŸš›

A **C++ project** using **OpenCV DNN** and **YOLOv5 (ONNX format)** to detect and count vehicles from multiple camera feeds in real time.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* Loads **YOLOv5n (nano)** model in ONNX format for lightweight real-time inference.
* Runs detection on **multiple cameras simultaneously** using C++ multithreading.
* Supports both **CPU** and **CUDA (GPU)** inference.
* Detects objects and overlays bounding boxes with class labels.
* Tracks **active vehicles per frame** and maintains a global vehicle count.
* Uses **frame skipping** for improved performance on lower-end hardware.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

* **C++17 or later**
* **OpenCV 4.5+** (with DNN module enabled)
* **CUDA/cuDNN** (optional, for GPU acceleration)
* YOLOv5n ONNX model (`yolov5n.onnx`)
* Classes file (`classes.txt` with COCO class labels)

Install OpenCV (Linux example):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

For CUDA build, ensure OpenCV is compiled with `-D WITH_CUDA=ON`.

## ðŸš€ Build Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoobSaifii/vehicle-detection-yolov5.git
cd vehicle-detection-yolov5
```

2. Create a `build/` directory and compile:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

* Bounding boxes drawn around detected vehicles.
* Per-frame vehicle count overlayed.
* Final output:

```
Total vehicles detected across all cameras: 235
```
